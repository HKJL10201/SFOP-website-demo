        <h3>Outreach Information</h3>
        <br />
        <h4>Star Parties:</h4>
        <p>
          We have telescopes available to bring to your school, park, city
          event, etc. backed by experienced astronomers and students from the
          University Of Utah. Depending on the size of your group, we can
          schedule up to seven telescopes (if we have the availability) for
          the event ranging from 8" to 24" in diameter. Although we reserve
          the 24" for very large groups considering the time and effort
          required to transport it and set it up. Solar telescopes are also
          available to view safely during the day time for school groups and
          others. These include white light filters for exceptional sunspot
          viewing and H-alpha telescopes for prominences, flares, faculae, and
          filaments.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h4>Presentations:</h4>
        <p>
          We have built a list of presentations that can be catered to most
          ages and groups. The list includes topics such as black holes,
          cosmology, stars, our Sun, planets, and more. Physics demos are also
          available for gravity, electricity, waves, energy, and more.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h4>Need more?</h4>
        <p>
          Feel free to contact us if you don't see something on the list that
          you'd like to learn or have for your classes and groups. We can
          develop new presentations and demos to fit your needs and can follow
          Utah State Core guidelines to help your classroom experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Star parties and presentations can be given to private groups but we
          ask for a donation to our department to help fund our free outreach
          for the community.
